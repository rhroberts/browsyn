WIP. A synthesizer in the browser, built on the
[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
Currently a toy project, but hopefully something usable for audio production in the
future. The name is a bad portmanteau made in service of a future, better one: a drum machine called Browbeat ðŸ˜‰
