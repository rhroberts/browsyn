# WebSynth

Name is TBD. A web-based synthesizer.

Possible names:

- Browbeat
  - better for a drum machine :p
- Browsyn

I'm imagining that this will be a collection of tools down the road, so perhaps
they should be namespaced somehow. For example, a namespace of "Carbon" would
give "Carbon Synth", "Carbon Kit", etc. Will wait for better inspiration to
strike though...

## Design

### Synth

- MIDI input?
  - Otherwise would need to provide a keyboard...
    - Might need this regardless for better useability and prototyping
- Monophonic
- Two or three oscillators
  - each oscillator can be one of triangle, square, sin, etc. wave
- FilterS
  - Delay
  - Reverb
  - (maybe) Compression
- Envelopes?

### Application

#### Color Palette

- Background: #2f2f2f
- Foreground: #ffffff
- Accent 1: #fffa77
- Accent 2: #56eca6
- Accent 3: #3dbdd4
